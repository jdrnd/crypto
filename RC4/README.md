#### RC4

An implimentation of the RC4 stream cypher.

Note: From [1]: "The RC4 algorithm does not meet the basic criteria required for an encryption algorithm, as its output is distinguishable from random. The use of RC4 continues to be recommended against; in particular, its use in new specifications is discouraged."

Test vectors taken from [1]. Implimentation details from [2].
